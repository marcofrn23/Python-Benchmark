# Python Benchmark

Project for "Computer architectures and networks" held by Prof. A. Mancini at UNIVPM

The aim is to test and highly improve python code performances to compare them with C++ ones.
To achieve this it will be used the just-in-time compilation function provided with the ***Numba*** python module. Other options such as parallelization for multi-core execution will be tried out.

*"Numba gives you the power to speed up your applications with high performance functions written directly in Python. With a few annotations, array-oriented and math-heavy Python code can be just-in-time compiled to native machine instructions, similar in performance to C, C++ and Fortran, without having to switch languages or Python interpreters."*

For this Project I will use some important numerical calculus algorithm, such as methods for solving ODEs and matrices factorizations.

Numba is supported by Anaconda and it is integrated in the **Python scientific stack**.

```
git clone git://github.com/numba/numba.git
```
```
$ conda install numba
```
